# Fixed-Layout Page Samples

All of the `.xhtml` files in this folder are samples of what pages in a standard fixed-layout children's book might look like. Most content consists of an image that is used as a background, and some text or figures laid over top.

Fixed-layout can be used for a variety of types of content, like comics, manga, children's books, and cookbooks. Often, the more complicated the page layout, the more likely it is that the publisher may opt to create the page as an image only, in order to avoid issues with reading systems not displaying the content as they want.

In this folder we have a few samples, and more will be created to illustrate various scenarios.

* `bg_image.xhtml` demonstrates a standard page where there is only an image with text embedded
* `image_w_text_inlinestyles.xhtml` demonstrates a page where there is an image with text overlaid using `<span>` and inline styles
* `image_w_text.xhtml` demonstrates a page where the there is an image with text overlaid using `<span>` and a CSS stylesheet
