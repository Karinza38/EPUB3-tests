# Instructions for the EPUBCheck Test Tool

This is a bash shell script for testing a series of EPUB files against EPUBCheck. This script should work for both Windows and MacOS machines.

To use the tool, have two things ready:
1. A folder for the test EPUB files (make sure all files are in a common location for ease of testing!)
2. Location for whatever version of EPUBCheck you choose to use

## Notes: 
If you get a "location not found" error, it is likely because of the formatting of the location, remember not to use "/" at the end of the folder string to ensure the location works properly.
